        <p> I'm a collector. I curate and often wholesale the goods of my many interests; 
            Looking for a great comic or book to read? 
            Do you have enough Die for your next D&D session?
            Does your cutlery collection make the cut?
            Have you found enough decent spawning grounds for those non-seasonal Pokemon?
            If you've answered "NO" to any of these questions, chances are I Have or Will be helping you shortly.
            I'm an art nerd, musician, salesman and linguist who's working on learning a few new languages!
            It all started a few decades ago with my first comic book and that's where my love of the the assorted arts and collecting began.
            I look forward to collaborating with you and having you join the ranks of my clients, fans, family and friends.
        </p>

        <P> As a Junior Coder, I am learning more C#/c++ for precision, patience and proficiency. 
            I am learning Python for expedience, and diversity of experience. 
            I am learning more HTML/CSS for fun, for relevance, for my own storefront and merch exposure.
